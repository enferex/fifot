fifot: Collect stats and report the contents of a FIFO
======================================================

What
----
fifot listens on a fifo and collects line count and byte count information about
the data passing through the fifo.  For more information regarding FIFOs, check
the man page for `mkfifo'

fifot opens the fifo specified by the user and reads data passing through that
fifo.  This tool can display that information to stdout acting similar to the
`tee' command. Terminating fifot with ctrl-c (SIGINT) will display the
statistics collected.


Notes
-----
This tool will utilize the CPU intensively since it must perform a tight-loop
checking for updates to the fifo.

Currently this tool assumes ascii data delimited by newline characters.


Build
-----
Run `make' in the fifot directory.


Use
---
To report data passing through the fifo:
    `./fifot -f /path/to/myfifo -d'

Other options are available by checking the help message:
    `./fifot -h'
